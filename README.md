# EduShield – School Cybersecurity Risk Management Database

## Overview
EduShield is an educational database project designed to support the analysis, monitoring, and prevention of cybersecurity incidents in school environments. The project focuses on structuring incident-related data in a clear and scalable way, enabling risk evaluation, reporting, and preventive decision-making.

This project was developed for participation in **EDB StartUP 2026**, organized by **Adfaber**, and serves as a proof of concept for how data-driven approaches can improve cybersecurity awareness and preparedness in schools.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to provide a structured data model that:
- Centralizes cybersecurity incidents reported within a school
- Identifies vulnerable zones and high-risk areas
- Supports preventive measures and training strategies
- Enables risk analysis and consultative decision support

The system is intended for **educational and demonstrative purposes**.

---

## Database Structure
The database models the full lifecycle of a cybersecurity incident, from detection to response and prevention. It is further explained in the code folder of this project.

---

## Risk Assessment Logic
The database supports risk evaluation by:
- Assigning severity levels to incidents
- Applying higher risk weighting to high-sensitivity zones (e.g. administrative or staff-related areas)
- Calculating response time between incident reporting and resolution
- Aggregating incident history to identify zones with increased risk

Risk scores are used to classify zones into qualitative risk levels (Low, Medium, High) for easier interpretation.

---

## Reporting and Analysis
Based on the structured data model, the system enables:
- Incident summaries by zone and school
- Risk distribution diagrams
- Identification of critical and vulnerable areas
- Generation of consultative recommendations for prevention

These reports can be represented through tables, charts, and diagrams to support decision-making.

---

## Educational Scope
This project is developed as an **educational prototype**:
- It demonstrates database design principles
- It supports learning about cybersecurity risk management
- It emphasizes prevention and awareness rather than real-time threat detection

Any analysis or prediction generated by the system is **advisory in nature**.

---

## Technologies & Tools
- Conceptual and logical database design (ERD)
- SQL-oriented relational modeling
- Optional integration with a C++ consultative analysis module
- Diagramming tools (e.g. drawDB / Oracle Data Modeler concepts)

---

## Competition Context
This project was created for **EDB StartUP 2026**, an initiative by **Adfaber**, aimed at encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, and technical problem-solving among students.

---

## Disclaimer
EduShield is not a real cybersecurity monitoring system. All scenarios, data, and analyses are simulated for educational and demonstration purposes only.

---

## Team
This project was developed collaboratively by a student team as part of a school competition entry.
